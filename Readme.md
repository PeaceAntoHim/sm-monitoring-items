🚧 The full project setup and code is too large to fit into a single message. I will break it down into these complete parts, one by one:

1. 🔧 **Project Structure Overview**
2. 🗃️ **Database Physical Model** (ERD and Schema)
3. 🔄 **Activity Diagram**
4. 📦 **Backend (.NET 9 - Web API)**
5. 🖥️ **Frontend (Blazor or Razor Pages, Responsive Bootstrap UI)**
6. 📊 **Dashboard & Reports (Export to Excel)**
7. 📝 **README file with usage guide**
8. 📚 **Authentication & Authorization (Role-based)**
9. 🧾 **Logging** (Serilog)
10. ✅ **Approval workflow logic (2-level)**

Let's begin with the **Project Overview and ERD**. Once that is set, I will deliver the next part in sequence.

## 🧩 2. ERD / Physical Data Model (Simplified)

### Entities:

- `User` (Admin / Approver)
- `Vehicle` (owned / rented)
- `BookingRequest`
- `Approval`
- `Driver`
- `FuelConsumption`
- `ServiceRecord`
- `Log`

### Relationship Overview:

```plaintext
User(1)───<(BookingRequest)
User(1)───<(Approval)
BookingRequest(1)───1(Driver)
BookingRequest(1)───1(Vehicle)
Vehicle(1)───<(ServiceRecord)
Vehicle(1)───<(FuelConsumption)
